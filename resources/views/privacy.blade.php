                    <p>New flavours, new combinations, new ways of bringing flavour to life. To your life. Because in almost
                        every UK kitchen cupboard there’s at least one flavour ingredient that’s the product of our
                        expertise.</p>
                    <p>
                        We have two manufacturing plants, one for our ‘wet’ range and one for ‘dry’. Between them we have
                        the capacity to pack formats ranging from small glass jars for retail outlets to one tonne bulk
                        containers used by food manufacturers.</p>
